# simple ANN regression model using a feedforward
 This MATLAB code implements a neural network regression model using a feedforward network with 18 hidden neurons and the resilient backpropagation training algorithm (trainrp) to fit a sinusoidal function modified by a cosine term, visualizing the original data and the network's output for comparison.
